# Update events with the Obsidian Google Calendar API

The plugin allows you to update events on you own. The function `updateEvent` is publicly exposed so codeblocks from templater or dataview can access it.

## Usage

The arguments of the `updateEvent` function is a GoogleEvent object and a flag if reoccurring events should be updated aswell. This object has to contain the required fields listed in the [Google Calendar API documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/events).
The second argument `updateAllOccurrences` is a boolean that defaults to false. If it is true and the event is reoccurring, it will update all occurrences of the event.

## Example (templater script)

~~~markdown
<%*
const {updateEvent, getEvents} = this.app.plugins.plugins["google-calendar"].api;
const events = await getEvents({});

events[0].summary = "Updated summary";
await updateEvent(events[0], false);
%>
~~~
