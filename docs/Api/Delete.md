# Creating events with the Obsidian Google Calendar API

The plugin allows you to delete events on you own. The function `deleteEvent` is publicly exposed so codeblocks from templater or dataview can access it.

## Usage

The first argument of the `deleteEvent` function is a GoogleEvent object. To define the calendar where the event is created add a field `parent` containing a GoogleCalendar object. If no parent field is set the functions uses the default calendar. The second argument `deleteAllOccurrences` is a boolean that defaults to false. If it is true and the event is reoccurring, it will delete all occurrences of the event.

## Example (templater script)

~~~markdown
<%*
const {deleteEvent, getEvents} = this.app.plugins.plugins["google-calendar"].api;
const events = await getEvents({});
await deleteEvent(events[0], false);
%>
~~~
