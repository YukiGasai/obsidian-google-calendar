title: Obsidian Google Calendar Plugin
---

Welcome to this documentation 👋.
On this website the core functionally of the Obsidian Google Calendar Plugin is explained.

## Getting Started

To get started install the plugin from the community plugins tab in Obsidian.
After installing the plugin you have to authenticate with Google.
This process is described in detail on the [[Setup]] page.

## Overview

After authenticating with Google you can open all the [[Views]] provided by the plugin to interact with your personal Google Calendar.

Use the [[Commands]] the plugin provides to open [[Views]], insert data about events and more.

Besides the Views and Commands the plugin also provides Options to create Notes linked to events.
These notes are called [[EventNote | EventNotes]].

You can use [[FrontmatterActions]] to update events from the content of your [[EventNote | EventNotes]], or use the [[AutoImport]] function to automatically create [[EventNote | EventNotes]] for events in your calendar.

When writing an ordinary note you can use the [[AtAnnotation | @Annotation]] to reference your events and insert data about them.

The plugin provides even more functionality that is not described here.
Maybe take a look a at this familiar looking Graph view to get an idea of what else is possible.

[[Here | UserExamples]] is also a list of user created Examples that show how the plugin can be used.
